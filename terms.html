				<strong>GENERAL CONDITIONS OF USE</strong>
			</h1>
			<p align="center">
				<strong>- WHYMPR -</strong>
			</p>
		</div>

		<h2>
			<u>Article 1 - Preamble and object</u>
		</h2>
		<p>
			The WHYMPR mobile application (hereinafter called “the App”) is published by 
			the simplified joint-stock company WHYMPR, whose head office is located at 289 
			Chemin du Clos du Savoy – 74 400 CHAMONIX – MONT-BLANC, registered under number 
			RCS 829 892 207, represented by Mr Timothy MacLean in his capacity as CEO 
			(hereinafter called “WHYMPR”).
		</p>
		<p>
			The App is designed to facilitate mountain excursions by suggesting existing 
			routes, offering professional advice and providing user feedback to any natural 
			person wishing to prepare for a mountain excursion for leisure purposes, exclusive 
			of professional use (hereinafter called the “USER” or the “USERS”). 
		</p>
		<p>
			The purpose of the present General Conditions of Use is to cover the relationship 
			between WHYMPR and the USERS using the App. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The USER acknowledges that, prior to downloading the App and registering, he has 
			read the present general conditions of use and accepts them without restriction 
			or reservation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The creation of an account by the USER implies unreserved acceptance of the present 
			general conditions of use as defined below, and the USER undertakes to abide by them.
		</p>
		<h2>
			<u>Article 2 - Registration requirements</u>
		</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>2.1 - Technical requirements</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			USERS must have their own equipment and connecting instrument and internet connection, 
			at their own expense, to use the App, it being specified that certain functions can 
			only be accessed without an internet connection through a subscription to the paid 
			version.
		</p>
		<p>
			In any event, USERS remain responsible for their IT environment and the compatibility 
			of their equipment with the App. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2.2 - Registration and account creation</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Only natural persons may register to use the App.
		</p>
		<p>
			To access the services offered by WHYMPR on the App, the USER must create an account 
			by completing the form and filling in online information and identification fields.
		</p>
		<p>
			Registering to use the App is personal and an account must be created for each USER, 
			it being specified that each USER may create only one account.
		</p>
		<p>
			By registering, the USER declares and guarantees that:
		</p>
		<p>
			- he is a natural person and enters into the contract as such;
		</p>
		<p>
			- he is an adult and is fully legally entitled to make a commitment under the present 
			General Conditions;
		</p>
		<p>
			- he does not enter into the contract as a professional or in the context of his 
			professional activity.
		</p>
		<p>
			When his account is created, the USER is requested to select a password that the USER 
			undertakes to keep confidential and therefore he will refrain from transferring it or 
			communicating it to a third party. In the event of his failure to do so, WHYMPR will 
			not be held liable for unauthorised access to a USER’s account.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2.3 - Right to cancel</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<u></u>
		</p>
		<p>
			Pursuant to the provisions of the Consumer Code, the USER has the right to cancel for 
			a period of fourteen calendar days with effect from registration to use the App, 
			without having to provide justification or incurring penalties.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, USERS are reminded that the right to cancel cannot be exercised for service 
			provision contracts of which performance has already commenced, with the agreement of 
			the consumer, before the expiry of the period of fourteen calendar days.
		</p>
		<p>
			This will be the case each time that the USER downloads the App on to his mobile 
			telephone.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2.4 - De-registration and deletion of the App</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Without prejudice to his right of withdrawal, the USER has the opportunity to 
			de-register and delete his account at any time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The USER is free to delete the App by uninstalling it from his phone at any time, 
			at no cost.
		</p>

				after deduction of the amounts corresponding, up to that date, to the performance of 
				the agreement.
			</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>
				The provisions of the present article apply without prejudice to those which legally 
				subject certain agreements to specific rules relating to consumer information.
			</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><em>Article L215-2: </em></strong>

		</p>
		<h2>
			<strong><u>Article 5 - Obligations of the USER</u></strong>
		</h2>
		<p>
			The USER undertakes:
		</p>
		<p>- to comply with the recommendations of WHYMPR and more specifically with the terms of the 
			present general conditions;</p>
		<p>- to use the App responsibly and with good judgement: under no circumstances can the App 
			replace the recommendations of a mountain professional;</p>
		<p>- not to publish content (images, photographs, comments, etc.) contrary to public order and 
			to accepted standards of behaviour or prejudicial to third parties (defamation, attack on 
			private life, etc.);</p>
		<p>- not to publish content (images, photographs, comments, etc.) prejudicial to intellectual 
			property rights held by a third party;</p>
		<p>- to comply with current laws and regulations;</p>
		<p>- to make strictly personal use of the App and, in any case, not to make professional or 
			commercial use of the App and/or its content.</p>
		</p>

		<p>
			The USER shall be fully and solely liable for any prejudice resulting from the failure to 
			respect the present general conditions, WHYMPR being exempt from all liability relating 
			thereto.
		</p>
		<h2>
			<strong><u>Article 6 - Liability</u></strong>
		</h2>
		<p>
			<br/>
			<strong>
				6.1 - Liability for the content posted by the USER
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			WHYMPR accepts no liability for content posted to the App (images, photographs, comments, 
			etc.) by the USER but reserves the right to moderate or delete the said content if it is 
			prejudicial to the rights of a third party or contravenes, in any way whatsoever, current 
			laws and regulations.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				6.2 - Accessibility of the App and malfunctions
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			WHYMPR undertakes to make every effort to ensure that the App is accessible and operational at 
			all times. However, in this regard, WHYMPR is bound only by a best-efforts obligation rather 
			than a performance obligation, as WHYMPR offers no guarantee of continuity of its services.
		</p>
		<p>
			In particular, no liability can be attached to WHYMPR in the event of any malfunction or 
			failure to operate by the App resulting from no or poor 3G/4G coverage or the absence or poor 
			quality of the GPS signal. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, WHYMPR reserves the right to temporarily interrupt accessibility to the App for 
			reasons of maintenance, to repair and/or upgrade. However, WHYMPR undertakes to make every 
			effort to minimise the interruption time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Consequently, the USER declares that he is familiar with the Internet and accepts its limits 
			and constraints. In particular, he acknowledges that:
		</p>
		<p>
			- the reliability of transmissions is random because, notably, of the heterogeneous nature of 
			the infrastructures and networks on which they circulate and that, in particular, outages or 
			overloading may occur;
		</p>
		<p>
			- restrictions to access to certain networks may exist and be dependent on the conclusion of 
			a specific agreement;
		</p>
		<p>
			- internet users can connect their computer equipment wherever they are and notably can, as 
			the case may be, divert, distribute, alter, destroy or falsify data, software and/or content 
			circulating on the internet, and can do so notwithstanding the establishment of procedures to 
			control access, notably by password or other access codes. Consequently, it is the 
			responsibility of the USER to take all measures that he deems appropriate to ensure the 
			security of his equipment and his personal data, software or  other items, in particular from 
			contamination by any virus and/or intrusion attempts to which he might fall victim;
		</p>
		<p>
			- all equipment used for connection to the App is and remains the entire responsibility of the 
			USER.
		</p>
		<p>The USER acknowledges that he uses the App at his own risk and undertakes to take all necessary 
			precautions to use the App in compliance with the present general conditions of use. 
		</p>
		<p>Consequently, no liability can be attached to WHYMPR by the USER for any damage, notably in the 
			event of loss of data and/or damage to the USER’s equipment, which may occur as a result of 
			using the App.
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore, WHYMPR will accept liability only in the event of damage resulting from a 
			malfunction blocking access or making it impossible or very difficult for USERS to use the 
			App, which has been proved to be exclusively attributable to WHYMPR. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In any case, the liability of WHYMPR, if it was proved, would be limited to supplying access 
			to the App pursuant to the terms of the present general conditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Reparation for any other damage and notably any indirect damage, material or intangible, such 
			as moral prejudice, financial damage, loss of opportunity, earnings forgone, loss of profit, 
			damage to image, etc. is excluded
		</p>
		<p>
			WHYMPR holds an insurance policy guaranteeing the financial consequences of its civil 
			liability should it arise.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				6.3 - Safety rules for mountaineering activity – Liability of the USER
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				The USER uses the App under his sole and entire responsibility. WHYMPR can under no 
				circumstances guarantee the quality, accuracy or exhaustiveness of the information 
				supplied in the App.
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			WHYMPR will under no circumstances accept liability for any document or content, including, 
			but not limited to, any error or omission in any document or content, or for any loss, injury 
			or damage of any nature incurred as a result of the use of any document or content available 
			on the App.
		</p>
		<p>
			Minors are requested not to use the App unless an adult is present.

		</p>
		<p>
			It is to be noted that information is supplied to the App by various users, mainly 
			non-professionals, based on their own experience, their own level of activity and their own 
			capabilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, the USER recognises and expressly agrees that the App and its content is not designed 
			to fully meet his individual needs and that it is therefore his responsibility to ensure that 
			the route he has chosen is within his range, accurate and accessible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Information made available on the App does not serve to replace the advice or recommendations 
			of a qualified professional when making decisions on the ground. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, the App must be used as a tool assisting direction-finding and decision-making but 
			cannot under any circumstances replace the assessment and judgement of the USER who alone 
			remains in control of his safety and his choices, particularly in the face of external data.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this regard, it must be noted that the practice of sports and mountain activities requires 
			comprehensive knowledge of the terrain and conditions and the acceptance of a degree of risk 
			matching the individual’s abilities and experience. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, the USER is reminded that the natural world is permanently evolving and that 
			the conditions of accessibility and feasibility of a route may change depending on the 
			seasons, weather conditions, etc. and WHYMPR in no way guarantees the protection of the 
			USER against all these objective natural dangers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The USER is requested to submit any change and/or error of which he may be aware and any 
			comment concerning the route to WHYMPR in order to update the route and/or improve the 
			service.

		</p>
		<p>
			In any case, the USER is called upon to use the App with care and good judgement in the 
			interpretation and use of the documents and content. The USER remains solely responsible for 
			his safety and his choices during the excursion. Also, he alone is capable of assessing his 
			own physical capabilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			In particular, the USER must take account of the difficulty of the route, the configuration 
			of the space and of his technical and physical capabilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			The USER must be equipped with the necessary safety equipment for the activity in question.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before his departure, the USER must familiarise himself with the following information in 
			particular:
		</p>
		<p>
			- opening and closing hours of the cable car serving the routes, if appropriate;
		</p>
		<p>
			- emergency phone numbers;
		</p>
		<p>
			- weather forecasts;
		</p>
		<p>
			- possible municipal decrees governing the activity in question.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				WHYMPR accepts no liability in the event of incidents of any kind which may result from 
				the use or interpretation of content supplied in the App.
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				It must be noted that the majority of the functions of the App are not accessible without 
				online access. Only the paid version allows content to be seen without network coverage, 
				provided that the USER has selected and downloaded the said content while connected to the 
				internet. It is therefore the responsibility of the USER to make the necessary arrangements 
				in this regard before any excursion.
			</strong>
		</p>


		<h2>
			<strong><u>Article 7 - Intellectual property</u></strong>
		</h2>
		<p>
			<strong></strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				7.1 - Intellectual property rights of WHYMPR
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The layout, structure and graphic and textual elements of the App as well as all content 
			directly supplied by WHYMPR are the property of WHYMPR and subject to laws governing 
			intellectual property.
		</p>
		<p>
			The use of the App confers no right on USERS other than their personal, non-transferable 
			and non-exclusive use of the App and its content.
		</p>
		<p>
			Consequently, USERS cannot, under any circumstances and in any way, reproduce, represent, 
			distribute, market, copy, translate, adapt, extract and/or decompile all or part of any one 
			of the elements reproduced in the App and all or part of the App in general, without the 
			prior express written agreement of WHYMPR, except for the content which they have originated 
			or which belongs to a third party, subject, in such circumstances, to observing the terms of 
			the licence chosen by their author. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				7.2 - Intellectual property rights of the USER
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The USER remains the sole and only holder of the intellectual property rights over the 
			content which he publishes in the App (whether it be sharing an experience or creating a 
			new route, including textual elements, photographs, etc..), when these are original, under 
			the terms of the intellectual property code.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, the USER is reminded that as purely technical and objective data do not 
			constitute originality, defined as the “imprint of the author’s personality” by French 
			jurisprudence, they are not intended to be protected by copyright and may therefore be 
			freely used and reproduced.
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, it is expressly agreed that by posting content to the App, the USER acknowledges 
			that the said content may be distributed to all the App’s users.
		</p>
		<p>
			In particular, the USER expressly acknowledges and accepts that evaluations and comments made 
			about his excursion shall be freely distributed on the App and accessible to all users of the 
			said services as information for the user community. The USER may, however, decide not to 
			share his content or his feedback with the community by disabling the share button. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The USER therefore grants WHYMPR, worldwide and for the entire duration of copyright 
			protection, the right to reproduce, modify, represent the said content on the App, without 
			any financial reward, which the USER explicitly acknowledges.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition, the USER declares and guarantees that he is the owner of the content that he 
			puts online and that it is free of all rights, or, at the very least, that he has the 
			necessary rights for their distribution through the App, and the Site.
		</p>
		<p>
			THE USER also undertakes that each person represented, as the case may be, has given his 
			consent to the use and distribution of his image.
		</p>
		<p>
			THE USER exempts WHYMPR from all potential claims by third parties against him on the 
			grounds of violation of their rights.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>
				7.3 - Intellectual property rights of third-party publishers
			</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Certain content supplied by the App is and remains the intellectual property of a 
			third-party publisher.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is then the responsibility of the USER to familiarise himself with the terms of the 
			licence chosen by this publisher for each content element and to comply with them, subject 
			to civil and criminal liability with respect to this third party.
		</p>
		<p>
			This content will be identified as such on the App by showing the corresponding logo and 
			reference will be made to the applicable licence.
		</p>
		<p>
			In particular, the content distributed under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA Licence subject 
			to the terms of the licence whose provisions are listed in the following website: 
			<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en">

		<h2>
			<strong><u>Article 8 - Personal information</u></strong>
		</h2>
		<p>
			Typology of data collected:
		</p>
		<p>
			The personal information collected and subsequently processed by WHYMPR is that supplied 
			voluntarily by the USER via the App.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>User name, email, town, country, preferred language.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Purpose of data collection:  
		</p>
		<p>
			- to enable the USER to create a single account to identify himself to the other members of 
			the community;
		</p>
		<p>
			- to adapt the services and excursions offered by WHYMPR to the USER;
		</p>
		<p>
			- to communicate with the USER by email in order to inform him of the new services available 
			on the App.
		</p>
		<p>
			The USER authorises WHYMPR to save his personal information in a file, to enable the smooth 
			operation of the services offered within the App, computerised profiling of the USERS and 
			customer management. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Transmission of data to third parties:</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The information collected may, as necessary, be transmitted to our technical service 
			providers (IT service providers, host sites, etc.), to ensure a positive response to the 
			USER’s requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			The USER’s personal information is not transferred outside the European Union.
		</p>
		<p>
			The USER agrees that WHYMPR may use personal information for its own marketing activities.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Duration of data storage:</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			The data are stored and kept for the period of time strictly needed to achieve the 
			above-mentioned purposes. 
		</p>
		<p>
			USERS are informed that, under current French and European regulations, they have the 
			following rights subject to proof of identity:
		</p>
		<p>
			- the right to object, for legitimate reasons, to their personal data being used for any other 
			purposes than those stated in the current agreement to which they have consented;
		</p>

			In the event of failure by the USER to discharge any of the obligations for which he is

			it could claim, to legally terminate the USER’s account and to remove all access to the App

			does not accede to this request within the period stated in the letter of notice, WHYMPR will 
			be legally entitled to terminate the contract and to delete the USER’s account. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In the event that the breach identified concerns a key obligation of the agreement and cannot 
			be rectified or is the result of lack of awareness or violation of a regulation, WHYMPR will 
			be entitled to terminate the account and remove all access to the App without giving any prior 
			notice, within twenty-four (24) hours following receipt of this notification by email at the 
			address given by the USER.
